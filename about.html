                <p class="text-blk description">
                    BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is
                    intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a
                    healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI
                    is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending
                    on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and
                    age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very
                    severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is
                    an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional
                    testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI
                    that are used by the calculator.

                    <p class="text-blk description">
                        being overweight increases the risk of a number of serious diseases and health conditions. Below
                        is a list of said risks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
                    <ul>
                        <LI> High blood pressure</LI>
                        <LI>Higher levels of LDL cholesterol, which is widely considered "bad cholesterol," lower levels
                            of
                        <LI></LI>HDL cholesterol, considered to be good cholesterol in moderation, and high levels of
                        triglycerides
                        <LI>Type II diabetes</LI>
                        <LI>Coronary heart disease</LI>
                        <LI>Stroke</LI>
                        <LI>Gallbladder disease</LI>
                        <LI>Osteoarthritis, a type of joint disease caused by breakdown of joint cartilage</LI>
                        <LI>Sleep apnea and breathing problems</LI>
                        <LI>Certain cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, liver)</LI>

                        <LI>Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI</LI>
                        As can be seen from the list above, there are numerous negative, in some cases fatal, outcomes
                        that may result from being overweight. Generally, a person should try to maintain a BMI below 25
                        kg/m2, but ideally should consult their doctor to determine whether or not they need to make any
                        changes to their lifestyle in order to be healthier.

                    Limitations of BMI
                </p>
                <p class="text-blk description">
                    Although BMI is a widely used and useful indicator of healthy body weight, it does have its
                    limitations. BMI is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to
                    a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI
                    should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method
                    for determining a person's healthy body weight.

                    <b>In adults:</b>

                    BMI cannot be fully accurate because it is a measure of excess body weight, rather than
                    excess body fat. BMI is further influenced by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, muscle
                    mass, body fat, and activity level, among others. For example, an older person who is
                    considered a healthy weight, but is completely inactive in their daily life may have
                    significant amounts of excess body fat even though they are not heavy. This would be
                    considered unhealthy, while a younger person with higher muscle composition of the same BMI
                    would be considered healthy. In athletes, particularly bodybuilders who would be considered
                    overweight due to muscle being heavier than fat, it is entirely possible that they are
                    actually at a healthy weight for their body composition. Generally, according to the CDC:
                <ul>

                    <LI>Older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults with the same BMI.</LI>
                    <LI>Women tend to have more body fat than men for an equivalent BMI.</LI>
                    <LI>Muscular individuals and highly trained athletes may have higher BMIs due to large muscle
                        mass.</LI>
                    <LI> High blood pressure</LI>

            <p><b>BMI formula</b></p>
            <p>
                Below are the equations used for calculating BMI in the International System of Units (SI) and the US
                customary system (USC) using a 5'10", 160-pound individual as an example:
                <b>
                    USC Units:
                    BMI = 703 ×
                    mass (lbs)
                    height2 (in)
                    = 703 ×
                    160
                    702
                    = 22.96
                    kg
                    m2
                    SI, Metric Units:
                    BMI =
                    mass (kg)
                    height2 (m)
                    =
                    72.57
                    1.782
                    = 22.90
                    kg
                    m2</b><br>
                <br>
                <b>BMI Prime</b><br>
                BMI prime is the ratio of a person's measured BMI to the upper limit of BMI that is considered "normal,"
                by
                institutions such as the WHO and the CDC. Though it may differ in some countries, such as those in Asia,
                this upper limit, which will be referred to as BMIupper is 25 kg/m2.

                The BMI prime formula is:
                <b>
                    BMI prime =
                    BMI/
                    25</b>
                Since BMI prime is a ratio of two BMI values, BMI prime is a dimensionless value. A person who has a BMI
                prime less than 0.74 is classified as underweight; from 0.74 to 1 is classified as normal; greater than
                1 is classified as overweight; and greater than 1.2 is classified as obese. The table below shows a
                person's weight classification based on their BMI prime:

                <img src="7.png">
                <p>BMI prime allows us to make a quick assessment of how much a person's BMI differs from the upper limit of BMI that is considered normal. It also allows for comparisons between groups of people who have different upper BMI limits.</p>
            <b>Ponderal Index</b>
            The Ponderal Index (PI) is similar to BMI in that it measures the leanness or corpulence of a person based on their height and weight. The main difference between the PI and BMI is the cubing rather than squaring of the height in the formula (provided below). While BMI can be a useful tool when considering large populations, it is not reliable for determining leanness or corpulence in individuals. Although the PI suffers from similar considerations, the PI is more reliable for use with very tall or short individuals, while BMI tends to record uncharacteristically high or low body fat levels for those on the extreme ends of the height and weight spectrum. Below is the equation for computing the PI of an individual using USC, again using a 5'10", 160-pound individual as an example:
